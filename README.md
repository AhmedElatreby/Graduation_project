## Personal Safety Application



## This application to aid a user finding themselves in an emergency, to access support from their designated contacts. This application was created after a background study of current applications available on the market. Despite there being approximately 200 applications available, these are either costly, have limited features or are not user-friendly.
From a background study, it was established that physical assaults are widely spreading among university students. When in an emergency, a person is often under pressure. They are unable to process vast amounts of information or often think rationally. Therefore, the design of the application needed to be simple and easy to use. Following feedback gathered from two focus groups, there were areas for improvement, and as result, a second development was created to further improve the application.
